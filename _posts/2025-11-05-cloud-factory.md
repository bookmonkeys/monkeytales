There wasn't a cloud in the sky, she knew, on her way down the garden path from her cottage. Even in the dark of the early morning, even without the moon on the ridge, she knew there were no cloud yet, there's wasn't a one. There wouldn't be even one until she got to the cloud factory in the village and started making them. For that was her job, every morning to prepare and release the clouds that would drift away whichever way the light autumn breeze would take them. The ground under her feet was crunchy, frozen. The frost on the grass like little clouds, she thought, amused at herself for seeing clouds and things about clouds everywhere. "Well, you do think about clouds all the time, Nimbus." she thought to herself. "It's to be expected when you are from the our family, the family in the cloud cottage."

It wasn't yet light enough to see the factory ahead, its silver chimney, its long thin wooden building, the logpile outside. But she knew it was there, waiting to make clouds. Soon there would be deep, cottony ones, maybe wispy ones, or even little, fluffy clouds. She hadn't decided yet. 

As she prepared the machines of the factory - opening the , cranking the, making sure the reservoir of water was mostly full but not over filled - she was thinking in the back of her mind what kind of cloud to make today?

In the end she decided for the kind of cloud that would lie like blankets on the river, and mostly over the lake. She loved that kind, of cloud, a cloudbank her father had called it. 

Then she had a bright idea! "I know, I'll make two kinds of clouds today!" She was already sure that she would make a lot of the cloudbank kind, but which other kind? Then she remembered the older machine that only worked sometimes, the one that makes little wispy clouds. "I'll make a few of those too." She liked those ones, wispy like they weren't really there, like you could see through the edges of them. The kind that clung to the ledges high up on the mountain sides and lasted well into the mid-morning. Everyone loves those ones, she thought, cranking the big lever that opened up the chimney. "Well, everyone except the goats that get lost in them and are then surprised when the find the edge of the wisp and discover the rest of the mountain has no clouds, She laughed as she recalled the quizzical look on their tiny goat faces when they come out into the sun.

She set the older machine in motion and crossed her fingers that it would behave today. The wispy cloud machine made a clunking noise, shuddered a bit, she held her breath, and then, then!, the machine belched our a little cloud. "Success" she cried, as the first little cloud drifted peacefully towards the roof. She rushed to open the big roof window, where even as that first cloud was going up and out, the early morning sunlight was coming in and down. "I better get a move on, it's almost morning." 

My work is sup important she thought, after all, if I don't get the cloud factory up and going before the village is out and about, what will the valley do for cloud cover today? It's needed.



r, nit evena fff ibe. He knew this, beccause befir ehe got to work atbthe cloud factory there couldnt qqqbee any cliuds. 

Who would have made them? she huffed. Almost indignant at the idea that anyone else but she could make the clouds.

### Old man's dream of volcano ring clouds

Meanwhile at home in the cloud cottage the old man was still half asleep. He missed working at the cloud factory, he had done it for many year, but now it was his daughter's turn. She's doing a better job than me, he thought, sleepily. It was too early to get up and see what clouds she was making today. It was always a surprise, he never guessed right. 

I wonder is she making storm clouds today? She's probably not, that more for winter, another month or so until it's cold enough for that. Thinking of the cold winter coming, he pulled the blankets back up around his head and fell back asleep. He dreamed of clouds. He always dreamed of clouds. It was his favourite dream, the volcano lake one. 

He stands on the shore of the placid lake, a volcano bowl of a lake, almost completely round. He sees the shore all the way around, almost a perfect circle, unbroken except for the village over there to one side and the volcano itself across the other side. The clouds came from inside the mountain's cone, rising out of its circular rim, the clouds themselves perfect circles, and hollow on the middle like giant Os. One after another they came, gently rising to twice the height of the volcano when the breeze would catch them and push them across the lake. Once they reached the middle, of the water they would start to fade, widen, and slowly disappear. He tried to follow each one to the end but never was able to. They were gone at some point in time, some point impossible to say exactly, but gone for sure. But there's another one coming behind it, free from the volcano and starting its journey across the lake. 

In his sleep, the old man scratched his nose, something he did when he was happy.

## Nimbus' dream of summer day clouds

At the cloud factory, Nimbus see the last of the morning cloudbank float clear of the chimney. She sees the last of the wispy clouds go out the roof window. She uncranks the levers, shuts the reservoir, checks the logpile for tomorrow. Before she leaves she turns out hte lights. It's easy to forget this last thing because it's now daytime and the autumn sun starting to stream in will in time melt away the cloudbank.
