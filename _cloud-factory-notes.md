# Notes for Cloud Factory

It's a work in progress and these are the notes for possible use.

## Old Man

Cirrus (Ci): Detached clouds in the form of white, dedicate filaments or white or mostly white patches or narrow bands. These clouds have fibrous (hair-like) appearance, or a silky sheen, or both.

## Clouds

Stratus (St): Generally grey cloud layer with a fairly uniform base, which may give drizzle, ice prisms or snow grains. When the sun is visible through the cloud, its outline is clearly discernible. Stratus does not produce halo phenomena except, possible, at very low temperatures.

Cumulus (Cu): Detached clouds, generally dense and with sharp outlines, developing vertically in the form of rising mounds, domes or towers, of which the bulging upper parts often resembles a cauliflower. The sunlit parts of these clouds are mostly brilliant white; their base is relatively dark and nearly horizontal. 

Cirro, from which cirrus is obtained means "wisp of hair".

Nimbo: means "rain". Thus, nimbostratus and cumulonimbus are clouds from which precipitation occurs.

Mother-clouds
Mammatus: Drooping underside (pouch-like appearance) of a cumulonimbus cloud
in its latter stage of development. Mammatus most often are seen hanging from the
anvil of a severe thunderstorm, but do not produce severe weather. They can
accompany non-severe storms as well.

## Features

Their form (cloud in banks, veils, sheets, layers, etc.);
Their dimensions (areas of their constituent elements, vertical extension, etc.);
Their internal structure (clouds made up of ice crystals, water droplets, etc.);
Known or assumed physical processes which may enter into cloud formation (clouds due to orographic phenomena, etc.).
